    <h2>About Us</h2>

    <p>
      The Weill Cornell Data Science Club is a student organization focused on
      encouraging the exploration the application of data science both inside
      and outside the medical realm. The goals for this club also include
      fostering cross-institutional interaction and helping members grow
      personally and professionally through cultivating a skillset in data
      science. We encourage students of all backgrounds and experience levels to
      join. Throughout the course of the year, we will have guest talks from
      professors from both the Weill Cornell Campus and the Ithaca campus as
      well as mini lessons to help further oneâ€™s skillsets in technical as well
      as professional development.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to our guest talks and mini lessons, the Weill Cornell Data Science Club also hosts various events and activities throughout the year. 
      These include hackathons, coding challenges, data visualization contests, and networking sessions with data science professionals in academia and industry. 
      Our members also have the opportunity to collaborate on data-driven research projects and contribute to the development of open-source data tools and resources. 
      By participating in these activities, members can gain hands-on experience in applying data science to real-world problems and develop a deeper understanding of the field.
    </p>
    <p> 
      Moreover, the Weill Cornell Data Science Club is committed to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in the data science community. 
      We strive to create an inclusive and welcoming environment for all members, regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, or disability status. 
      We believe that a diverse and inclusive community fosters creativity, innovation, and collaboration, and is essential for advancing the field of data science. 
      As such, we welcome students of all backgrounds and experience levels to join us and be part of our mission to promote the responsible and ethical use of data for the betterment of society.
