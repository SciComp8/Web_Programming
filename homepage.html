  <h2>About Us</h2>

  <p>The Weill Cornell Data Science Club is a student organization focused on
    encouraging the exploration the application of data science both inside
    and outside the medical realm. The goals for this club also include fostering
    cross-institutional interaction and helping members grow personally and professionally
    through cultivating a skillset in data science. We encourage students of all
    backgrounds and experience levels to join. Throughout the course of the year, we will have guest talks from professors
      from both the Weill Cornell Campus and the Ithaca campus as well as mini lessons
      to help further oneâ€™s skillsets in technical as well as professional development.</p>
